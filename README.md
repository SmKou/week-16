# Week 16

By: Stella Marie

Week 16 of Epicodus: Help queue demo project done in different JS frameworks.

## Description

Help queue is a ticket manager for Epicodus students to report issues to their teachers. Consists of CRUD functionality for tickets. Each version of Help Queue is based on the original project modified from the Epicodus lessons on LearnHowToProgram to use Typescript. All other versions from the first are scaffolded using Vite.

**Frameworks**
- React
- Svelte
- SvelteKit
- Vue

## Complete Setup

- Navigate to project repo
- Either fork or clone project
- Install dependencies: ```npm i```
- Either use ```npm run start``` to run build and launch the dev server, or use ```npm run view``` to run build and launch the preview server

## Known Bugs

**React TS**
- Change reusable form: edit form requires filled fields
- Reorganize buttons, handlers and values
- No data validation (enables empty field submission)

Please report any issues in using the apps included in this project.
